# Information Retrieval Course Final Project

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
First, create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On Unix or MacOS:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
This project uses Poetry for dependency management. Install Poetry by running the following command:

```bash
pip install poetry
```

Once Poetry is installed, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Step 3: Run the FastAPI Server
To serve the FastAPI application, run the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The `--reload` flag enables hot-reloading, which automatically reloads the server when you make changes to your code.

### Step 4: Access the API Documentation
After running the server, open your web browser and go to the following address to view the API documentation:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```

This will display the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI, where you can explore the available endpoints and test them directly from the browser.
